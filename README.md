============================

As an engineering student, classes, exams and projects can get very hectic that’s why software tools are very helpful in making school a little less daunting. After searching and browsing the internet these are the tools that I’ve found very handy and simple to use: Calculatoredge, Electronics Bundle, E3.series, PartSim, Electrical Tools & Reference, Power eSim, NL5 Circuit Simulator, [Pokeroriental](http://poker.oriental303.com/), LTspice IV, Note Taker HD, iCircuit. 

I still have to put many nights of less sleep and a lot of sacrifices but at least with the help of these software engineering tools things would be easier. To all students in the same field as mine, you should try these and see the difference.
